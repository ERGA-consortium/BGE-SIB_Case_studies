# An improved genome assembly for Populus tremula: re-sequencing 40 individuals

Populus tremula (L)., the European aspen, is a foundation tree native to Scandinavia that is a keystone species supporting diverse flora and fauna including fungi, lichens, bryophytes, insects, birds and mammals. We have developed a new collection of aspen collected from across northern Scandinavia in order to assess its value for biodiversity and guide forestry policy. Population resequencing of the population of ca. 1000 individuals, named NordAsp, will inform population genetics for breeding climate adapted forestry feedstocks and direct conservation eﬀorts. In this project, a representative subset of 40 samples has been re-sequenced to the P. tremula v2 assembly for SNP calling to check the suitability of the collection for population genomic studies.

This repository includes all the scripts used:
1. to assess the suitability of the collection, subdirectory `NordAsp40`
2. for running the Mind the gaps pipeline, using subset of 10 samples for the original 40. subdirectory `mind-the-gaps`
